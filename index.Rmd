This is a sample document, to illustrate diplay page of 'gh-pages' website.  Testing that the page is built successfully again. Recommitting.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
